To use pointers and access elements of array and find address of different data types.

# Software Used
VS Code

# Problem Statement

1.) Write a c++ program to find address and incremented address of variable stored in different data types.

2.) Write a c++ program to access elements of array using pointer variable.

3.) Write a c++ program to access elements of array without using pointer variable.

# Theory

Pointers are symbolic representations of addresses. They enable programs to simulate call-by-reference as well as to create and manipulate dynamic data structures. Iterating over elements in arrays or other data structures is one of the main use of pointers.
